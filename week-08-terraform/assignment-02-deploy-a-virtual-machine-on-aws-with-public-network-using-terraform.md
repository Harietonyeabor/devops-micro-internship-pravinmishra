# Assignment 2 — Deploy a Virtual Machine on AWS with Public Network Using Terraform

Part of the DevOps Micro Internship (DMI) Cohort 3 with Agentic AI

---

## Purpose

In this assignment, you will use Terraform to create a custom AWS network (VPC, public and private subnets, Internet Gateway, route table) and launch an EC2 instance into the public subnet with a public IP, a Security Group allowing SSH and HTTP, and Nginx installed for validation.

---

# Task 1 — Create a New Terraform Project

## Goal

Create a `terraform-aws-vm` project directory for the AWS Terraform configuration.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 1 — File Explorer, VS Code, or terminal showing the `terraform-aws-vm` project directory

# Task 2 — Create main.tf with the Required AWS Resources

## Goal

Define the AWS provider, a VPC (10.0.0.0/16) with a public subnet (10.0.1.0/24) and private subnet (10.0.2.0/24), an Internet Gateway with public routing, a Security Group (SSH 22, HTTP 80), an EC2 instance in the public subnet with a public IP, and a public IP output.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 2 (optional) — `main.tf` showing the VPC and EC2 resource blocks

# Task 3 — Initialize Terraform

## Goal

Run `terraform init` and confirm the working directory initializes successfully.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 3 — Terminal showing successful `terraform init` output

---

# Task 4 — Plan and Apply the Configuration

## Goal

Review `terraform plan`, run `terraform apply`, and record the EC2 instance's public IP from the Terraform output.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 4 — Terraform apply output showing successful completion

---

#### Screenshot 5 — Terraform output showing the EC2 public IP

---

# Task 5 — Verify the Deployment

## Goal

Confirm the EC2 instance is running in the public subnet with a public IP, install Nginx, and confirm it is accessible by browser or SSH.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 6 — EC2 instance running in the AWS Console, with the subnet and public IP visible

---

#### Screenshot 7 — Browser showing the Nginx page through the EC2 public IP, or terminal showing a successful SSH connection

---

# Task 6 — Destroy Resources

## Goal

Run `terraform destroy` to remove the Terraform-managed AWS resources after testing.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 8 — Terminal showing successful `terraform destroy` completion

### Notes

Write a short paragraph about any challenges you faced and how you solved them.

During this assignment, I successfully automated the deployment and teardown of an AWS EC2 instance inside a custom VPC architecture using Terraform. One initial challenge involved configuring the AWS CLI credentials where an incorrect parameter order in the configuration file caused an unknown output format error; I resolved this by explicitly targeting the CLI profile settings using aws configure set output table. Additionally, during the initial terraform apply, AWS rejected the t2.micro instance type due to regional Free Tier eligibility constraints (InvalidParameterCombination). I addressed this by updating the compute specification in main.tf to t3.micro and re-applying the configuration, allowing the EC2 instance to provision seamlessly while preserving the state of the underlying VPC, subnets, route tables, and security groups. Finally, to align with evaluation requirements for web verification, I connected via SSH using my configured RSA key pair to restore the default Nginx welcome page before executing a clean terraform destroy workflow to eliminate unnecessary cloud resource costs.
