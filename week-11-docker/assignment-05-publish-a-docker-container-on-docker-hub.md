# Assignment 5 — Publish a Docker Container on Docker Hub

Part of the DevOps Micro Internship (DMI) with Agentic AI

---

## Purpose

In this assignment, you will publish a Dockerized React application to Docker Hub, remove the local image tags, pull the image again from Docker Hub, and run it to verify that it can be downloaded and deployed from a container registry.

---

# Task 1 — Publish a Docker Image to Docker Hub

## Goal

Tag a locally built React image, publish it to Docker Hub, remove the local copy, pull it again from Docker Hub, and run it successfully.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 1 — Public Docker Hub Repository

Add a screenshot of Docker Hub showing your newly created public repository:

```text
my-react-app
```

![Public IP](screenshots/doc-hub-repo.png)

---

#### Screenshot 2 — Successful Docker Login

Add a screenshot of the terminal showing:

```text
Login Succeeded
```

Ensure that your full name is visible and that no password, Personal Access Token, or device code is exposed.

![Login Successful](screenshots/d-login.png)

---

#### Screenshot 3 — Correctly Tagged Image

Add a screenshot of the terminal showing:

```bash
docker image ls <YOUR_DOCKERHUB_USERNAME>/my-react-app
```

The output must show the `latest` tag.

---

#### Screenshot 4 — Successful Docker Push

Add a screenshot of the terminal showing successful completion of:

```bash
docker push <YOUR_DOCKERHUB_USERNAME>/my-react-app:latest
```

The output must include a pushed status or image digest.

---

#### Screenshot 5 — Published `latest` Tag in Docker Hub

Add a screenshot of your Docker Hub repository showing the uploaded `latest` image tag.

---

#### Screenshot 6 — Local Image Removed and Pulled Again

Add a screenshot of the terminal showing:

- The targeted local image tags removed
- Successful `docker pull` output
- `docker image ls` showing the pulled image

---

#### Screenshot 7 — Running Pulled Image

Add a screenshot of the terminal showing:

```bash
docker ps
```

The output must show the running `react-container` with:

```text
0.0.0.0:80->80/tcp
```

![TCP](screenshots/running-pulled-img.png)

---

#### Screenshot 8 — React Application in Browser

Add a browser screenshot showing the React application at:

```text
http://98.91.20.57
```

Ensure that the VM public IP is visible in the address bar. Add your full name as a clear caption directly below the screenshot.

# Registry and Image Tagging Notes

Write a short explanation covering:

- Why image tagging is required before pushing to Docker Hub
- Why a container registry is useful in DevOps workflows
- Why production deployments should use versioned image tags instead of relying only on `latest`

Why Image Tagging Is Required Before Pushing to Docker Hub:
Docker image tagging is required because it attaches your Docker Hub username and repository name to the image (e.g., henriettao/my-react-app:latest). This namespace routing tells the Docker daemon where in the registry the image belongs and what version tag to apply when uploading or downloading.

Why a Container Registry Is Useful in DevOps Workflows:
A container registry (like Docker Hub or Amazon ECR) acts as a centralized cloud storage system for container images, similar to how GitHub stores source code. It allows development teams to package an application once, publish it securely, and pull/deploy the exact same tested image consistently across development, testing, and production environments without rebuilding from source.

Why Production Deployments Should Use Versioned Image Tags Instead of Relying Only on latest:
While the latest tag is convenient for local testing and tutorials, it is a floating tag that changes every time a new image is pushed. In production, relying on latest introduces deployment drift and unpredictability. Versioned tags (e.g., v1.0.0, v1.2.1, or commit hashes) ensure immutability—guaranteeing that teams deploy the exact, auditable version of code intended without unexpected overrides.
